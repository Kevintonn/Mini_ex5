Title: Poem by candlelight

To interact with the sketch hold down the mouse button and move around the mouse.

The text used in the sketch is a poem by Dylan Thomas called "And Death Shall Have No Dominion". Using this as source material had a big effect on the outcome of my sketch. From the beginning i wanted to make something that i felt added to the mood of the poem.
